Note(s):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Hong Kong, the first released figures on GDP by economic activity in respect of a period are called ""preliminary figures"". When more data become available, the figures will be revised. All those figures published subsequently, after the preliminary figures, are called ""revised figures"". These ""revised figures"" are still subject to further regular revision later on when more data are incorporated. This routine revision is in accordance with the international practice to compile and release GDP figures at the earliest possible time by using only partial data. In general, the figures are finalised when finalised data from all regular sources are incorporated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
