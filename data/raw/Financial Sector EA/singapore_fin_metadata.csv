Definitions
Gross Domestic Product:
"Aggregate value of the goods and services produced in the economic territory of Singapore. The GDP estimates are compiled based on the output (or production), expenditure and income approaches. See Output-based GDP, Expenditure-based GDP and Income-based GDP."
Market Prices:
"The actual price agreed upon by the parties in the transactions. In the absence of market transactions, valuation is made according to costs incurred or by reference to market prices for similar goods or services."
Taxes on Products:
"Refers to taxes payable per unit of good and services when they are produced, delivered, sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by their producers."
Value Added:
"Gross value added is derived by the output or income approach. 
The output approach measures value added as output less intermediate consumption. Output refers to the value of goods and services produced  while intermediate consumption is value of goods and services consumed as inputs by a process of production, e.g. materials, utilities, fuel, rental paid for premises and equipment, banking and financial charges and other operating costs.
The income approach derives value added as the sum of incomes generated from the domestic production of goods and services, which comprise gross operating surplus, remuneration and taxes (less subsidies) on production. "
